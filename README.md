## ‚≠êInspiration

The goal is to conserve and sustainably use the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources due to their crucial role as the planet's life support and regulators of the global climate system. Oceans are the largest ecosystem, home to numerous species, and offer significant potential for scientific discovery. Despite their importance in supporting global economic, social, and environmental needs, decades of irresponsible exploitation have led to alarming degradation. Current conservation efforts fall short, and the COVID-19 crisis, while tragic, provides an opportunity for oceans to recover. It's also a chance to establish a sustainable recovery path that ensures livelihoods in harmony with the natural environment for the future.
